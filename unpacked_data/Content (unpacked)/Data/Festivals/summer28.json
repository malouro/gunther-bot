  "Abigail": "Such a rare and exciting thing... ",
  "Robin": "*yawn*... It's past my bed-time.$s#$e#Hey, did you see that candle-boat? I crafted it myself.$h",
  "Demetrius": "The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south.#$e#It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious.",
  "Maru": "It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner.",
  "Sebastian": "I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark.#$e#Just trying to scare you...$h",
  "Pierre": "Psst... Make sure to swing by the shop tomorrow to get your fall seeds!",
  "Caroline": "These candles are romantic, aren't they?",
  "Linus": "I'll just sneak up when the jellies arrive... I don't want to bother anyone.",
  "Alex": "I can't believe summer's over... I feel like it just started.$s",
  "George": "What, why are you looking at me like that? You think I'm too old to enjoy something like this?",
  "Evelyn": "I remember seeing the jellies once, as a little girl. Oh, how I jumped with joy when they arrived!#$e#But that was long ago... I'm a lot less energetic now.",
  "Lewis": "Good evening, @. The Moonlight Jellies are close... I already saw one glowing in the distance.#$b#Once we launch the candle-boat they'll come up to the docks and say hello.",
  "Clint": "I wore my special shoes tonight... No one noticed.$s",
  "Emily": "Look out there, at the endless sea. Deep underwater, all kinds of life forms are moving around in the dark.#$b#Eerie, isn't it?",
  "Penny": "Life is so easy for a jellyfish... just letting the waves carry you onward forever.",
  "Pam": "Don't tell Gus, but I'm a little disappointed there's no buffet tonight.",
  "Haley": "I'm gonna take a picture of the jellies when they arrive.",
  "Jodi": "There! I just saw something glowing!#$b#Oh... It's gone.$s",

  "Shane": "The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back again a year from now... nature is amazing.",
  "Marnie": "That's a heavy load of people for an ancient wooden dock! I'll stay over here near the beach.",
  "Elliott": "If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct. It's already in the process of happening.#$e#What a shame... we have no respect for nature anymore.",
  "Gus": "'Moonlight Jellies'... I wonder how they taste?$h#$b#I would never try it, of course!$u",
  "Dwarf": "You say it's raining up above? *gasp*#$e#Rain... It's almost mythical to us. Some of us live our entire lives without ever experiencing it.",
  "Wizard": "How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden.#$b#Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance.#$e#I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form.",
  "Harvey": "Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!",
  "Sandy": "I heard it's raining back home. Is that why you came here?$h#$e#I kind of miss the rain, actually...$s",
  "Jas": "I hope there are babies this year!",
  "Vincent": "I wanna see the rare green jelly!",
  "Willy": "Most night-fish would be scared of the light... these are strange ones.",
